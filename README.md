# Hand-Following-Car
Arduino UNO r3 and external battey powered
# Project Introduction
This hand-following car project uses Arduino as the brain of the operation. With the help of a motor shield, the Arduino controls the speed and direction of the motors, allowing the car to move smoothly.

Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect objects in front of the car. These sensors send out sound waves and measure how long it takes for them to bounce back, calculating the distance to any obstacles.

With the right code, the car moves forward while keeping a safe distance from objects in its path.

This project shows how combining hardware and software can create an autonomous vehicle, highlighting the power of technology in action.

# Real World Application
These are potential applications for the hand-following car project:



Automated Surveillance 
The car can be configured as a basic surveillance device, capable of following an intruder's movements. With the addition of a camera, it could record activity for security purposes.

Automated Material Handling
In warehouses, this type of vehicle could be used to move materials to a sorting point. It can detect and transport packages from one location to another without needing human assistance.

Disaster Response
Small autonomous vehicles like this could navigate through debris in disaster-hit areas to locate survivors using heat sensors or other detection tools.

Precision Agriculture 
In farming, such vehicles could be programmed to approach plants that need attention, delivering water or nutrients directly where they are required.

Parking Lot Car Finder
A similar system could help vehicles in large parking lots locate their owners by moving toward an activated signal.

Healthcare Facilities
In hospitals or care centers, this car could transport medical supplies by following a healthcare provider's hand movements, ensuring quick and hygienic delivery of essential items without direct contact.

# Working
depending on distance between left ultrasonic sensor and hand , rotation of motor changes which makes car to change direction to left same will apply to right hand side , Car moves to forward position if hand and car have certain seperation between them either it stops automatically.
